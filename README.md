AskRex Assistant is a local-first AI assistant for text chat, voice interaction, desktop control surfaces, and credential-gated home/productivity integrations. It runs from the Python `rex` package, with optional local ML dependencies for Whisper, openWakeWord, and XTTS, plus optional cloud/local LLM routing through OpenAI-compatible providers and Ollama.

AskRex is alpha software. It is useful for local testing and development, but it should not be treated as production-ready. Recent GUI and voice-loop fixes have made several paths usable end to end; wake-word tuning, warning cleanup, and per-user data separation are still in progress. See [docs/claude/INTEGRATIONS_STATUS.md](docs/claude/INTEGRATIONS_STATUS.md) for the broader integration readiness snapshot.

## Quick Start

Python 3.11 is required. Python 3.12 and newer are intentionally rejected by the current installers and runtime checks because the validated ML/TTS dependency path is Python 3.11-only.

1. Clone the repository and enter the project folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blueibear/AskRex-Assistant.git
cd AskRex-Assistant
```

2. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

3. Copy local config files and run the platform install script.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item config\rex_config.example.json config\rex_config.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Copy-Item .env.example .env -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
pip install .
.\install.ps1
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
cp -n config/rex_config.example.json config/rex_config.json
cp -n .env.example .env
pip install .
bash install.sh
```

4. Configure LM Studio for local model access at `localhost:1234`.

Download and install LM Studio, start the LM Studio server on `localhost:1234`, and load your preferred model.

5. Verify the install and run Rex.

```powershell
rex doctor
rex
```

```bash
rex doctor
rex
```

> **Advanced/Developer Install**: For GPU/CUDA setup, manual venv instructions, and development tooling, see [docs/advanced-install.md](docs/advanced-install.md).

## Current Status

This README reflects the current milestone after recent live testing and repair work. The Electron GUI is the current primary user-facing interface. The repo has usable CLI, chat, GUI, Home Assistant, and voice paths, with several areas still being stabilized.

## Working Now

- Core CLI help and doctor paths work: `rex --help`, `rex doctor`, and `python -m rex doctor`.
- Basic text chat works in the CLI and GUI.
- The Electron GUI launches and the main shell is stable.
- GUI pages load for Tasks, Reminders, Settings, Users, Integrations, Email, Calendar, and Home Assistant.
- The Home Assistant page loads and lists entities after the recent GUI/backend consistency fixes.
- The Home Assistant connection test now stays connected in the UI after a successful real connection test.
- GUI Chat shows a visible pending/thinking state while Rex is preparing a reply.
- Voice Hold to Talk records, transcribes, shows a pending state, gets a Rex reply, and can be used repeatedly.
- Wake-word mode is wired and can work end to end in live testing, but reliability and latency still need work.
- Long voice answers now use a cleaner spoken handoff that points the user to the on-screen transcript instead of reading long replies badly.
- Custom wake backends are wired: built-in openWakeWord fallback, `custom_embedding` as an interim path, and `custom_onnx` as the long-term target when a real asset is present.
- Day/date phrasing coverage in chat has improved for common variants.

## Known Limitations / In Progress

- Wake-word reliability is still inconsistent and may require threshold/device tuning.
- Wake-word response latency is slower than desired.
- The repo does not ship a real `Hey Rex` custom wake asset. A valid asset is still required for `custom_onnx` or `custom_embedding` to become active.
- Outlook integration status in the GUI should not be read as full mailbox/calendar sync readiness. Live Outlook email/calendar sync is still incomplete.
- CLI identity listing is currently polluted with test/demo users.
- A deprecated `wake_word` config warning still appears during startup.
- A `.env` permissions warning still appears.
- Some pages and integrations are still in active stabilization; do not assume every registered integration is production-ready.

## Planned Future Implementation

- Per-user GUI login.
- Personal vs shared data isolation.
- Personal vs shared integrations.
- Per-user chat histories with the ability to continue prior chats.
- Per-user reminders, tasks, notifications, and memories.
- Scoped document/context uploads with an upload-time choice for personal, shared, or universal access.
- Small GUI polish items, including increasing the size of the top-left AskRex logo.

## Main Entry Points

| Surface | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CLI text chat | `rex` or `python -m rex` | Working basic chat |
| Diagnostics | `rex doctor` or `python -m rex doctor` | Working |
| Voice loop | `python rex_loop.py` | Working in live testing; tuning ongoing |
| Electron desktop app | Windows: `cd gui; npm.cmd run dev`; macOS/Linux: `cd gui && npm run dev` | Current primary GUI under active stabilization |
| Python/Flask local API and experimental web dashboard | `rex-gui` | Starts Flask on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`; local API routes are still useful, but the browser dashboard UI is incomplete and not the primary interface |
| TTS API | `rex-speak-api` | Implemented service, default `127.0.0.1:5005` |
| OpenClaw tool server | `rex-tool-server` | Implemented service, default `127.0.0.1:18790` |
| Windows computer agent | `rex-agent` | Optional remote PC control agent |
| Runtime config CLI | `rex-config` | Config inspection and legacy env migration; warning cleanup remains |

The Electron app under `gui/` is the current primary GUI. `rex-gui` remains useful as a local Flask/API service and for compatibility testing, but its browser dashboard at `/ui/` is incomplete and should not be treated as the main user interface. The legacy Tkinter launchers (`gui.py` and its entry point) are deprecated.

## Features

| Area | Current repo state |
|---|---|
| Text chat | Basic CLI and GUI chat work through `rex.assistant.Assistant` and the configured LLM provider. Common day/date phrasing coverage has improved; provider quality still depends on model/configuration. |
| Voice pipeline | Hold to Talk works. Wake-word mode is wired and can work end to end through openWakeWord, Whisper STT, LLM reply generation, and TTS, but reliability and latency are still being tuned. Long answers now hand off to the transcript instead of reading a long reply aloud badly. |
| Custom wake support | Built-in openWakeWord remains the safe fallback path. `custom_embedding` is usable as an interim path, and `custom_onnx` is the target path for a real `Hey Rex` wake model. The repo does not ship that custom asset by default. |
| LLM providers | Local Transformers, OpenAI-compatible API settings, and Ollama routing are supported by config. Local model output quality varies by model and prompt path. |
| Configuration | Runtime settings live in `config/rex_config.json`; secrets live in `.env`; profiles live in `profiles/`. |
| GUIs | The Electron/React desktop GUI (`gui/`) is the current primary interface. The Electron shell is stable in current testing; Tasks, Reminders, Settings, Users, Integrations, Email, Calendar, and Home Assistant pages load. The Python/Flask `rex-gui` surface still serves local API routes and an experimental `/ui/` browser dashboard, but that browser UI is incomplete and not recommended as the primary interface. |
| Home Assistant | The GUI Home Assistant page loads and lists entities after recent fixes. The connection test performs a real backend connectivity check and persists success in the UI. |
| Email and calendar integrations | GUI integration status is more honest than before, but Outlook-connected status should not be read as full live Outlook mailbox/calendar sync. Treat Outlook email/calendar paths as partial until end-to-end sync is working. |
| CLI integrations | `rex email`, `rex calendar`, `rex msg`, `rex notify`, `rex gh`, `rex code`, `rex pc`, `rex wp`, `rex wc`, `rex ha`, `rex shopping`, `rex usage`, and more are registered. Readiness varies by backend credentials and test coverage. |
| Tool execution | Tool registry, policy checks, audit logging, and OpenClaw-facing HTTP tool server are implemented. Local tool execution currently covers time, weather, and web search; the HTTP tool server exposes a broader adapter set. |
| Memory | Memory storage paths exist under `Memory/` and `data/memory/`, and GUI chat history uses `data/history.db`. Full per-user GUI history/memory isolation is planned, not complete. |
| Notifications | Priority routing, quiet hours, digest/escalation logic, CLI commands, and Electron notification UI plumbing are present. Full per-user notification behavior is planned, not complete. |
| WordPress/WooCommerce | WordPress health checks and WooCommerce order/product reads are implemented; WooCommerce order status and coupon writes are approval-gated. |
| OpenClaw | HTTP gateway/client adapters and a standalone Rex tool server are present; feature flags under `openclaw` control gateway-backed paths. |

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.11 only |
| OS | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| FFmpeg | Required for parts of the audio/TTS stack |
| Audio hardware | Microphone and speakers for voice mode |
| Node.js/npm | Required only for the Electron GUI under `gui/` |
| GPU | Optional NVIDIA CUDA path via `requirements-gpu*.txt` |

On Windows, use `py -3.11 ...` or activate the repo `.venv` before running commands. A system default `python` that points at 3.12+ will be rejected.

> **Note**: On Windows, audio playback requires simpleaudio. Install it with `pip install simpleaudio` if audio output is not working.

## Configuration

AskRex uses three configuration layers:

1. `config/rex_config.json` for non-secret runtime settings such as audio, wake word, models, UI, integrations, and feature flags.
2. `.env` for secrets such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `HA_TOKEN`, `REX_SPEAK_API_KEY`, `REX_TOOL_API_KEY`, Twilio credentials, and search/weather keys.
3. `profiles/<name>.json` for profile-level capabilities and runtime overrides.

The canonical wake word config key is `wakeword`. The legacy `wake_word` key is still migrated at runtime but logs a warning.

Custom wake asset defaults now follow:

- `config/wake_words/hey_rex/model.onnx` for `custom_onnx`
- `config/wake_words/hey_rex/embedding.pt` for `custom_embedding`

The repo wiring is in place for a real custom `Hey Rex` wake path, but a valid asset file is still required before that path becomes active.

Useful config commands:

```bash
rex-config show
rex-config migrate-legacy-env --dry-run
rex-config migrate-legacy-env
```

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md), [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md), and [docs/environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md).

## GUI Usage

See [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md) for the full usage guide including voice mode, autonomous workflows, and integrations.

### Electron desktop GUI - Windows setup

Use Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd gui
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev

## Build and preview the compiled Electron app:
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run preview
```

### Electron desktop GUI - macOS setup

Use Terminal:

```bash
cd gui
npm install
npm run dev

npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Python/Flask local API and experimental web dashboard

Run this after activating the Python virtual environment on any platform when you need the Flask local API routes or want to inspect the incomplete browser dashboard:

```bash
rex-gui
## Flask listens on http://127.0.0.1:8765/
## experimental browser UI: http://127.0.0.1:8765/ui/
```

Use the Electron app for normal GUI testing and day-to-day interaction.

The Electron app requires the Python bridge scripts at the repo root and the current `gui/dist-electron` build for built-app verification harnesses. See [docs/UI_SURFACES.md](docs/UI_SURFACES.md) and [docs/e2e-gui-launch-test.md](docs/e2e-gui-launch-test.md).

Use `rex-gui` as a Flask/API and compatibility surface, not as the main GUI.

## Common Commands

After activating the virtual environment, these commands are the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

```bash
rex --help
rex doctor
rex tools -v
rex usage
rex memory stats
rex kb search "query"
rex plan "check weather in Dallas"
rex approvals
rex wc orders list --site myshop
rex wc coupons create --site myshop --code SAVE10 --amount 10 --type percent
rex ha tts test --message "Hello from Rex"
```

## Services

### TTS API

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:REX_SPEAK_API_KEY = "change-me"  # pragma: allowlist secret
rex-speak-api
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
export REX_SPEAK_API_KEY=change-me
rex-speak-api
```

Request format with curl, using macOS/Linux shell syntax or Git Bash/WSL on Windows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5005/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: change-me" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello from AskRex","user":"default"}' \
  --output speech.wav
```

### OpenClaw/Rex tool server

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:REX_TOOL_API_KEY = "change-me"  # pragma: allowlist secret
rex-tool-server
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
export REX_TOOL_API_KEY=change-me
rex-tool-server
```

Health endpoints with curl, using macOS/Linux shell syntax or Git Bash/WSL on Windows:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5005/health/live
curl http://127.0.0.1:18790/health/live
```

## Docker

Run AskRex in a container. See [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for build, run, and GPU options.

## Memory

AskRex stores per-user voice and conversation profiles under `Memory/`. See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md) for profile format and voice cloning notes.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues: missing ffmpeg, CUDA driver mismatches, wake word not triggering. See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions.

## Development

Python checks, after activating the virtual environment on any platform:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
pytest
ruff check .
black --check .
mypy .
```

Electron checks on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd gui
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run build
```

Electron checks on macOS/Linux:

```bash
cd gui
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The current coverage threshold in `pyproject.toml` is 75 percent. Test markers include `unit`, `integration`, `slow`, `audio`, `gpu`, `network`, `asyncio`, `anyio`, and `smoke`.

## Security

- Keep secrets in `.env` or `config/credentials.json`; do not put them in `config/rex_config.json`.
- `rex-speak-api` requires `REX_SPEAK_API_KEY`.
- `rex-tool-server` requires `REX_TOOL_API_KEY` for tool invocation.
- Approval-gated high-risk actions, such as WooCommerce writes and remote PC commands, require explicit confirmation flows.
